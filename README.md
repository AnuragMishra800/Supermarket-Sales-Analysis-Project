# 🛒 Supermarket Sales Analysis Project

A complete end-to-end **Python + Power BI** project designed to simulate real business analytics scenarios.  
This case study focuses on analyzing **Supermarket Sales Data** to extract actionable insights for improving **profitability, customer loyalty, and operational efficiency**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

A supermarket chain wants to:

- Understand its **sales performance**, product trends, and customer segments  
- Identify **peak buying hours**, **preferred payment methods**, and **branch-level comparisons**  
- Improve loyalty conversions and analyze customer feedback (via ratings)  
- Provide business users with an **interactive dashboard** for real-time decision-making

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze **sales, profit, and gross income** by **city, branch, and product line**  
- Track **customer behavior** by gender, type, and payment method  
- Detect **sales seasonality** (time of day, day of week) and high-performing periods  
- Build a **Power BI dashboard** that helps business users visualize insights quickly  
- Simulate real-world **KPI tracking** for operational and strategic decisions

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data cleaning, transformation, KPI generation  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation, data modeling, slicers, drill-downs  
- **Excel** – Initial data checks and exports  
- **Storytelling** – Translating raw data into meaningful business insights  
- **Visualization Best Practices** – Treemap, decomposition tree, funnel, bar/line charts, KPI cards

## 📊 Key Insights

- **₹322K+** in total sales across 3 branches  
- **Food & Beverages** and **Electronic Accessories** are the top-selling categories  
- **E-wallets** are the most preferred payment method (34% of transactions)  
- **Weekends** drive the highest sales volumes—optimize staffing accordingly  
- **Average Basket Size**: 5.5 items per transaction  
- **City-wise sales competition** is tight—Naypyitaw leads, but Mandalay is close  
- **Customer Loyalty Program** participation is under 50%—needs improvement  
- **Customer Ratings** remain stable even with high sales volume

## 🗺️ Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)

- Removed duplicates & checked for missing data  
- Converted `Date` and `Time` columns to datetime formats  
- Extracted new features: `Hour`, `Minute`, `Part of Day`, `Day of Week`  
- Calculated **Total Sales**, **Gross Income**, **Tax**, **COGS**, **Margin %**

---

### 2️⃣ KPI Generation (Python)

- **Total Sales**  
- **Gross Income**  
- **Average Transaction Value**  
- **Sales Per Day & Hour (Peak Time Detection)**  
- **Customer Visit Frequency (Repeat Buyer Simulation)**  
- **Loyalty vs Normal Customer Split**  
- **City & Branch-wise Sales & Profitability**

### 3️⃣ Dashboarding (Power BI)

| **Visual** | **Business Use** |
|------------|------------------|
| **Sales Over Time (Line + Rolling Avg)** | Detect seasonality |
| **Branch & City Sales (Clustered Bar)** | Compare locations |
| **Product Line Revenue (Treemap)** | Identify top products |
| **Customer Funnel & Loyalty Split** | Track retention |
| **Payment Preference (Pie/Donut)** | Understand customer habits |
| **Sales Per Hour (Column/Heatmap)** | Peak time analysis |
| **Decomposition Tree** | Root cause drill-down |
| **RFM Segmentation** | Customer value ranking |
| **Correlation Analysis (Scatter)** | Explore spend vs rating links |

## 💡 Suggestions Welcome!

Let me know if you want this saved as a file or want help building the folder structure (`assets`, `sql`, `data`, `reports`) too. Happy to help with that next.

Thank you for your support, and I look forward to connecting with you!
And don't hesitate to give me suggestions for better improvment.
